Description: two functions: One that returns true, one that returns false
 This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always
 returns true (trueFunc) and one that always returns false (falseFunc).
 .
 By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible
 to do some nice optimizations. Eg. CSSselect uses these functions to
 determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case,
 the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
